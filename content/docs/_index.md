# Raspberry Pi Router with RaspAP

These instructions show you how to turn a **Raspberry Pi** into a simple home or travel router using **RaspAP**, focusing on the **easiest possible setup**:

- use a **preconfigured RaspAP OS image** (no manual terminal install),
- walk through all steps with screenshots,
- explain networking terms as we go.

The guide is written for **beginners** who may be:

- new to Linux,
- new to routers and networking, or
- just tired of renting a router from their ISP.

An optional **advanced section** at the end points to manual installation and extra features (DNS blocking, VPN, etc.), so the main flow stays friendly and testable for first-time users.

Use the section navigation on the left to go step by step:

1. Why build your own router?
2. What hardware and software you need
3. Flashing the RaspAP image (with macOS / Windows / Linux tabs)
4. First boot and connecting to RaspAP
5. Securing and renaming your Wi-Fi
6. Testing and basic troubleshooting
7. Alternatives and next steps
8. Advanced / manual install (optional)
